# UPDATE 29.06.:-> reads map correctly now, calls objects correctly, but output window is still flauty
                -> issue is in initializing objects -> CHECK OBJECT INITIALIZATION
                ->probably issue in passing enum objects

# TODO: either have to figure out how to use enum objects or change enum to struct with mlx_image_t objects
# TODO: Code keyhook-function; test output
# TODO: Finish map validation functions
